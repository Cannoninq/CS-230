The Gaming Room was a client that wanted to release a game "Draw it or Lose It" for android. The company wanted to improve the software functionality and expand to all platforms.

The design document allowed me to focus on the task at hand.

4. If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

I would choose to revise the pros and cons sections since each different platform has updates and changes almost daily to the way that they function.

5.  How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

I took the functionality of the game and minimum requirements for the game.

6. How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?

I put my concentration on the documentation and seperating game and game needs functionality to allow easier updates and maintainance.
